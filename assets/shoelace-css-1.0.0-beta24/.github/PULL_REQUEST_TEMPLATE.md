### Pull Request Summary

Please describe what your PR does here.

---

Before embarking on a large, complex, or controversial feature, please open an issue so we can discuss it. Someone may be working on it already, it might not align with the project's roadmap, or we might be able to improve on your idea before you spend a lot of time working on it.

If your PR doesn't get accepted, don't let it get you down. Many don't. It doesn't mean I don't value your idea or contribution, it just means that it doesn't align with my vision for the project. As the maintainer, I'll do my best to explain why every PR doesn't get accepted.
